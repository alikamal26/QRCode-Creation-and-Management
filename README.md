The objective of this program is to be able to generate as many dynamic Qrcodes as wanted and be able to edit them afterwards or delete them and storing them in a table in which all the data are presented and we can physically know which Qrcode is physically placed where.

Steps:-
1) Press the create button and enter the desired URL and Restaurant name
2) Press generate button to generate the equivalent qrcode
3)Edit or Delete the Qrocde
4)Press the filter button at the top of table and enter the restaurant name to filter the table with the desired qrcode of the entered restaurant name
5)Qrcode can be downloaded by clicking on the qrcode itself

Other functionalities that can be implemented:-
1)increase the scalability by saving the data into a database and retrieve and apply operations using queries
2) track the number of scans of each qrcode as appeared in the table but not functional yet
3) track some data for each qrcode as the location in which the qrcode was generated, the device from which the qrcode was generated
4) add more attributes to the qrcode as restaurant table numbers and the could easily add the filter the categories by retrieving all qrcodes of a certain restaurant or of specific restaurant tables
